🎮 Code of Conduct — Pong-Game Open Source Project

🚀 Our Commitment
Welcome to the Pong Game Project — an open-source initiative built on fun, curiosity, and collective growth! Whether you're here to squash a bug, improve gameplay mechanics, enhance graphics, or simply learn the ropes of open-source collaboration, you belong.

We’re committed to creating an environment where everyone — from complete beginners to seasoned contributors — feels valued, respected, and safe. We believe that great games come from great communities, and that respect, inclusion, and kindness should be as fundamental as version control and code reviews.


🌟 Our Core Values:

In our pong-powered universe, we play by the following values:
🧠 Learn Openly: No question is too small, no contributor too new. We’re here to grow together.
🎮 Play Fair: Collaboration beats competition. Feedback should be kind, constructive, and focused on improvement.
🎉 Celebrate Contributions: From fixing typos to adding multiplayer support — every contribution matters.
🌍 Embrace Diversity: Different backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives make our project better and stronger.
🧩 Work Together: Success is a team sport. Share knowledge, uplift others, and focus on solutions.


🛑 What We Don’t Tolerate

To protect our community and ensure a welcoming experience for all, we do not tolerate:
🚫 Disrespectful language or personal attacks
🚫 Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
🚫 Gatekeeping or discouraging beginners
🚫 Unwanted private messages or contact outside official channels
🚫 Spam, off-topic promotion, or irrelevant content
🚫 Toxic competitiveness or putting down others’ work
🚫 Plagiarized code or cheating tools

Let’s keep the vibe positive and the game fun — for everyone!


🌐 Scope of This Code:
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including:
GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, comments)
Community discussions (Discord, Slack, forums, etc.)
Any event or interaction under the Pong Game banner


🧭 Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness misconduct, reach out directly to a project maintainer or admin. We take reports seriously and will handle them with confidentiality, care, and timely action.


⚠️ Possible Consequences

Based on the nature and severity and intent of the violation, actions may include:
- 🟡 Give a friendly reminder of the rules
- 🟠 Issue a formal warning
- 🔴 Temporarily suspend the user from community platforms
- ⚫ Ban the individual from contributing or participating in future events

We hope never to need these — but the safety and health of our community come first.


👾 Contributor Expectations

When writing code, reviewing PRs, or chatting in the community:
- Use respectful and inclusive language in comments, commits, and communication
- Give constructive, actionable feedback
- Keep your code clean, well-documented, and original
- Avoid memes or jokes that could be misunderstood or offensive
- Don’t take feedback personally — we all make mistakes and improve

📜 Attribution & Thanks  
This Code of Conduct was written specifically for the Pong-Game Project, inspired by best practices from open-source communities like [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) and customized to reflect our fun, beginner-friendly, game-loving ethos.

Let’s code. Let’s play. Let’s grow — together. 💚 

🌈 Final Note
This project is more than a game. It’s a community playground for learning, creativity, and connection. Let’s build something fun — and build each other up while we’re at it. 🎮💙
